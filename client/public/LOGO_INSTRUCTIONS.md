# Logo Replacement Instructions

Please replace the file `sagascript-logo.png` in this directory with your actual SagaScript Life logo image.

The logo should be:
- High resolution (recommended: at least 800x480 pixels)
- PNG format with transparent background
- The blue book with radiating pages and "SagaScript.Life" text as shown in your design

Once you replace the image, the logo will automatically appear:
1. In the sidebar (compact version)
2. On login/register pages
3. In the mobile header
4. As a subtle background watermark on all pages
5. As the favicon (simplified version)

The current placeholder will be replaced with your actual logo image.
